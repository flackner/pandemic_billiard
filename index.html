            I still have trouble understanding the viewport. I quess it is the visible area in a browser measured
            in real physical units of 1/96 inch = 1 px. Many of the dimensions set in the CSS file are in 
            px unites which means that the physical size is hardcoded. This of course is not very good. Probably 
            implementation using relative units sich as % and vw would be better. Another problem with the viewport is
            that it can change when the virtual keyboard is activeted. To keep the viewport fixed the size is fixed
            via javascript. In javascript the size of the viewport is accessible via window.innerWidth and 
            window.innerHeight.

            The javascript source file is executed right now. After execution of the javascript
            source file the fucntion and variables are available in the rest of 
            the document. However be careful not to search for HTML elements at this point.
            Since HTML elements are not defined at this point the script cannot find them!
            Once all HTML elements are loaded the function window.onload executes. By assining 
            "window.onload = init" the javascript function init is executed once the page is fully
